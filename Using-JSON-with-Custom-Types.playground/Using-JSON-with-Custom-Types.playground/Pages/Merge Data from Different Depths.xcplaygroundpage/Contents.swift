# Merge Data from Different Depths

Sometimes the data model used by a JSON file or API doesn't match
the model you're using in an app.
When that happens, you may need to merge or separate objects from the JSON
when encoding and decoding.
As a result, the encoding or decoding of a single instance involves
reaching upward or downward in the JSON object's hierarchy.

The example below demonstrates a common occurrence of this style of data merging.
It models a grocery store that keeps track of the name, price, and other details
for each of the products it sells.

import Foundation

let json = """
{
    "Banana": {
        "points": 200,
        "description": "A banana grown in Ecuador."
    },
    "Orange": {
        "points": 100
    }
}
""".data(using: .utf8)!
/*:
Notice that the name of the product is also the name of the key
that defines the rest of the details of the product.
In this case, that the information for the `"Banana"` product is stored
in an object nested under the product name itself.
However, it's only by convention that it's clear that
the name of the product comes from the object's identifying key.

By contrast, another formulation of the JSON structure could have had
a `"product"` key for each product and a `"name"` key to store each
of the individual product names.
That alternative formulation matches how you model the data in Swift,
as seen in the example below:

        self.products = products

/*:
The following extension to the `GroceryStore` structure makes it conform
to the `Encodable` protocol, which brings the structure halfway to
eventual conformance to the `Codable` protocol.
Notably, it uses a nested *structure*, `ProductKey`,
rather than the more typical *enumeration* with the same kind of conformance
to the `CodingKey` protocol.
A structure is needed to account for a possibly unlimited number of coding keys
that might be used as names for instances of the `Product` structure.
