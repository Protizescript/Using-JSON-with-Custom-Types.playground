# Read Data From Arrays

When the JSON you use contains a homogeneous array of elements,
you add a conformance to the `Codable` protocol on the individual element's type.
To decode or encode the entire array, you use the syntax `[Element].self`.

In the example below, the `GroceryProduct` structure is automatically decodable
because the conformance to the `Codable` protocol is included in its declaration.
The whole array in the example is decodable based on the syntax used in the call
to the `decode` method.

    },
    {
        "name": "Orange",
        "points": 100

/*:
If the JSON array contains even one element that isn't a `GroceryProduct` instance,
the decoding fails.
This way, data isn't silently lost as a result of typos
or a misunderstanding of the guarantees made by the provider of the JSON array.
